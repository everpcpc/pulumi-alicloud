/**
 * Provides a CAS Certificate resource.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** The Certificate name which you want to add must be already registered and had not added by another account. Every Certificate name can only exist in a unique group.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** The Cas Certificate region only support cn-hangzhou, ap-south-1, me-east-1, eu-central-1, ap-northeast-1, ap-southeast-2.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Available in 1.35.0+ .
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as alicloud from "@pulumi/alicloud";
 * import * as fs from "fs";
 *
 * // Add a new Certificate.
 * const cert = new alicloud.cas.Certificate("cert", {
 *     cert: fs.readFileSync(`./test.crt`, "utf-8"),
 *     key: fs.readFileSync(`./test.key`, "utf-8"),
 * });
 * ```
