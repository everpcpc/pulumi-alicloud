/**
 * Provides an ONS instance resource.
 *
 * For more information about how to use it, see [RocketMQ Instance Management API](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/106354.html).
 *
 * > **NOTE:** The number of instances in the same region cannot exceed 8. At present, the resource does not support region "mq-internet-access" and "ap-southeast-5".
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Available in 1.51.0+
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as alicloud from "@pulumi/alicloud";
 *
 * const example = new alicloud.rocketmq.Instance("example", {
 *     remark: "tf-example-ons-instance-remark",
 * });
 * ```
