/**
 * Provides a CEN instance resource. Cloud Enterprise Network (CEN) is a service that allows you to create a global network for rapidly building a distributed business system with a hybrid cloud computing solution. CEN enables you to build a secure, private, and enterprise-class interconnected network between VPCs in different regions and your local data centers. CEN provides enterprise-class scalability that automatically responds to your dynamic computing requirements.
 * 
 * For information about CEN and how to use it, see [What is Cloud Enterprise Network](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/59870.htm).
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * Basic Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as alicloud from "@pulumi/alicloud";
 * 
 * const cen = new alicloud.cen.Instance("cen", {
 *     description: "an example for cen",
 * });
 * ```
